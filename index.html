   <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      HTML is an abreviation for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to set up the structure of a webpage. Tags are used in HTML (< >) to define different elements that will be displayed. <br>
      Here are some examples of important tags:
<div>  
    <img src="HTMLCMMDS.jpg" width="750" height="250"/>
</div>
   <h2>What is CSS?</h2> 
      CSS is an abreviation for Cascading style sheets. It is used to style the web page by telling what the browser to display. 
      CSS uses the ({ }) tag to declare how something is displayed. 
      The name of the selector must be declared frist though.
      Here is an example:
    <div>
    <img src="CSSSTUF.jpg" width="471" height="300"/>  
    </div>
 
<h3> <div>Things to take away:</div> 
    HTML is the structure, while CSS is the styling.</h3>
