   <p>What is HTML?</p>
      HTML is an abreviation for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to set up the structure of a webpage. Tags are used in HTML (< >) to define different elements that will be displayed. <br>
      Here are some examples of important tags:<br> 
    
   <div>  
    <img src="images/importanttags.jpg" style="float: left;"width="750" height="250"/> <br>
   
</body>
   <p>What is CSS?</p>  <br>
      CSS is an abreviation for Cascading style sheets. It is used to style the web page by telling what the browser to display. CSS uses the ({ }) tag to declare how something is displayed. 
      The name of the selector must be declared frist though.
      Here is an example:
      <div>
    <img src="images/cssstuff.jpg" style="float: left;"width="400" height="250"/>
